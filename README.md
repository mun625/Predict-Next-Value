# Integer-Sequence-Learning

This repo contains Integer Sequences dataset which is provided from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/integer-sequence-learning) and [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/).


# Description

The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is a 50+ year effort by mathematicians the world over to catalog sequences of integers. If it has a pattern, it's probably in the OEIS, and probably described with amazing detail. This competition challenges you create a machine learning algorithm capable of guessing the next number in an integer sequence. While this sounds like pattern recognition in its most basic form, a quick look at the data will convince you this is anything but basic!


# Data Sets
